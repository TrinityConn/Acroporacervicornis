# Acropora cervicornis population genomics and haplotype panel 

This repository contains the code and data files associated my contributions to Duffin et al (in prep). These scripts represent work towards estimating diversity statistics and runs of homozygosity in the Caribbean reef-building coral _Acropora cervicornis_. The results are based on deep (50x) whole genome sequences from across the Caribbean generated to produce a haplotype panel for the Caribbean of _Acropora cervicornis_. __
